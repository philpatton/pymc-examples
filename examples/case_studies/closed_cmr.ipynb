    "Ecologists have been estimating population sizes with capture-recapture models for over a 100 years. The method appears to have been independently developed in 1889 by C.G. Johannes Petersen, who wanted to estimate the number of European Plaice (*Pleuronectes platessa*) at his Danish marine station, and in 1930 by Fredrick C. Lincoln, who was tasked with monitoring birds across the U.S. after the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918. The very first application of capture-recapture appears to have been by Laplace, who was trying to estimate the size of France's human population in 1783. Since then, researchers have developed countless forms of the basic capture-recapture model to account for complexities that arise in sampling wildlife populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a most capture-recapture analyses is to estimate the size of a population, which is arguably the baseline indicator for population health. (Although note that open forms of capture-recapture exist, where the goal is to estimate survival, recruitment, and the population trajectory.) The most basic form of capture-recapture involves capturing animals, marking them, releasing them, recapturing them on a later date, and determining the number of marked animals in the second sample. The process can be continued to include many samples (i.e., not just two). Then, we can estimate the probability of recapturing an individual, $p$, which we can use to estimate the population size, $N$. \n",

    "In this example, we'll estimate the size of a meadow vole population (*Microtus pennsylvanicus*), which was surveyed by Jim Nichols of the the US Geological Survey's Eastern Ecological Research Center {cite:p}`nichols1984use`.\n",

    "{cite:t}`nichols1984use` deployed a 10 by 10 grid of traps baited with corn, and checked the traps in $T=5$ consecutive nights to see if they contained a vole. Captured voles were marked and released. They captured $n_0=56$ voles in total. The observed dataset is a binary matrix of shape $(56, 5)$ where $1$ indicates that the individual was captured on that night. Researchers will often refer to each row as the \"capture history\" for that individual."

    "We are going to model these data with parameter expanded data augmentation {cite:p}`royle2009analysis`. Data augmentation works by setting an absurd upper limit to the population size, $M$. Then, we augment the observed dataset with $M-n_0$ all-zero capture histories. Each all-zero history either represents an individual that was never captured, or an individual that does not exist in the population. We can then estimate the inclusion probability $\\psi$, which represents that one of the $M$ rows in the dataset represents a true individual in the population. When the detection probability is constant across occasions, we can represent the process as a zero-inflated binomial distribution \n",
